# dbManolToTalk
Python program to get voice detection microphone activation on games and other programs.

<h2>What is a dbManol?</h2>
    <p>
    A dbManol is a unit of measure used for screaming or loud noises. Its name takes root on the name of a friend of mine that blows your eardrums every time he screams,
    which by the way happens often. I think I have to insist on the <b>LOUD</b> aspect of this unit.

<h2>What does this program do?</h2>
    <p>
    It allows the use of a pseudo voice activation mechanism for your microphone, which can be helpful for games or programs that do not have this feature (for example,
    having only an open mic option or a fixed volume for voice activation). It just detects sound from your microphone and activates a key whenever the volume goes 
    higher than a selected volume. Your game should have the same key mapped for push-to-talk. That's all.

<h2>What do I need?</h2>
